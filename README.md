By building a network of reliable, local contacts, dog owners can get extra support - plus, it’s a great way to meet people in your area.

What we do

We're proud to be the oldest welfare charity around.

We were the first to introduce a law to protect animals and work hard to ensure that all animals can live free from pain and suffering. Through our campaigns we raise standards of care, and awareness of issues, affecting animals today.

We rely on your support to help us push for changes in the law to improve the welfare of animals on farms, in labs, in the wild, in paddocks or our homes.

Through investigations and prosecutions we stand up to those who deliberately harm animals to send out a clear message - we will not tolerate animal abuse. Our highly trained officers tackle neglect and cruelty on every level working to stamp out animal cruelty a.

## Animals can rely on us to rescue them when they need us most. To rehabilitate them wherever possible, provide them with the very best veterinary care and to find them new homes, either through rehoming or release.

https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do

Saving pets is what we do.
PDSA is a charity. We have been taking care of pets in need for over 105 years. In 2022, vets and vet nurses in our 48 Pet Hospitals cared for over 4,600 sick and injured pets every day.
Caring for pets whose owners can’t afford the full cost of their veterinary treatment is the reason we’re here. But we’re also a leading authority on pet health, and we raise the status of animals by celebrating their contributions to our lives.

We believe that every pet deserves to lead a happy and healthy life and that everyone has the right to experience the love and companionship of a pet.

But we can’t do any of it without you. Your support is invaluable to keeping our doors open and helping us be there when pets need us most.
Our 48 Pet Hospitals are at the heart of what we do but our work goes much further than that. Our teams also work in schools and communities to raise awareness and educate the public on key issues that affect the UK’s pet population.
Prevent
We work with the UK's pet owners to prevent illness and suffering for the nation's pets.
